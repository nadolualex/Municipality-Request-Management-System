Municipality Request Management System (OOP Homework)

This Java program was developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) class assignment. It serves as a comprehensive solution for managing requests within a municipality setting. The assignment involved implementing various OOP principles and design patterns to create a robust and extensible system.

Key Features:

Object-Oriented Design: The program employs object-oriented principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to model different types of users and their corresponding actions.

Input/Output Handling: Robust input/output mechanisms allow users to submit requests via input files, with the program generating detailed output files containing processed requests and notifications.

User Types: The system supports different user types, including employees, individuals, students, and legal entities, each with distinct functionalities and request types.

Request Processing: Requests are processed based on user type and submission date, ensuring efficient handling and prioritization.

Error Handling: The program includes comprehensive error handling mechanisms to detect and handle exceptions gracefully, enhancing system reliability.

Sorting and Filtering: Requests are sorted and filtered based on submission date, improving organization and accessibility.

By completing this assignment, I gained a deeper understanding of OOP principles, design patterns, and practical software development techniques. The project provided valuable hands-on experience in building complex systems and applying theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios.
